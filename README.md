# Roly.jl
Roly (_Reverse-Search Polyform Enumerator_) is a Julia package for the enumeration of arbitrary polyforms via [reverse search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-search_algorithm). It allows you to exhaustively enumerate structures composed out of arbitrarily shaped building blocks and provides an interface to define your own building block geometries and binding rules.
## Installation
Roly currently has unlisted dependencies and is itself unlisted in the general Julia registy, but it can be installed directly from GitHub. To install Roly, first enter `]` into you Julia REPL to enter Pkg mode, and then run
